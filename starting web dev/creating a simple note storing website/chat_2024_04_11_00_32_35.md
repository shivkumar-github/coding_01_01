In CSS, the `background` property is a shorthand property that allows you to set all background properties (such as background-color, background-image, background-repeat, etc.) in one declaration.

On the other hand, the `background-color` property is used specifically to set the color of an element's background. It is a standalone property that only sets the color of the background without affecting other background properties.

So, in summary:
- `background`: Sets all background properties in one declaration.
- `background-color`: Sets only the color of the background.
