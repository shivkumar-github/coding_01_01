Problem statement
You are given a Binary tree. You have to count and return the number of leaf nodes present in it.

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child

A node is a leaf node if both left and right child nodes of it are NULL.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void inorder(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root, int &count)
{
    if (root == NULL) // base case for recursion
    {
        return;
    }
    inorder(root->left, count);

    // leaf node
    if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL)
    {
        count++; // -> print ki jagah count ko increase kardo
    }

    inorder(root->right, count);
}

int noOfLeafNodes(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root)
{
    int cnt = 0;
    inorder(root, count);
    return count;
}

int main()
{

    return 0;
