# Introduction to dynamic programmic
## Those who forget the past , are condemed to repeat it. -
 A wise man using dp
 It is about remembering 

 ### It is just about recursion and remembering
 there are two approaches of solivng these problems 
 ## 1 Top down - Recursion + Memorisation
 ## 2 Bottom up - Tabulation
 ## 3 Space optimisation

### for example
we can use dp to remember the fibonacce terms in recursive way so that no need to recalculate them again and again
