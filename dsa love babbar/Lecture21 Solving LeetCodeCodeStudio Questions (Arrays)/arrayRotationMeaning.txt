You raise a valid point. In the context of array rotation,
when we talk about "rotating an array at position 0," 
it essentially means shifting the elements to the left by a certain number of positions. 
 
If the rotation count is 0, then the array remains unchanged.

In general, the term "rotation" is used more broadly to describe a circular shifting of elements within an array. 
When we rotate an array to the left or right, elements move from one end of the array to the other,
creating a circular effect.
