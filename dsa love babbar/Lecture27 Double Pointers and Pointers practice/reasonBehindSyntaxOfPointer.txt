why we write data_type* ptr = &value and not 
    pointer ptr = &value
    ->> It tell us what type of data is and as we know what type of data is we can decide how much memory we need to allocate/reserve 
    ->> for example when we multiply *(pt1) * *(ptr2) if we know that pointers are pointing integer then we will reserve 4 byte memory for the answer


Storing in symbol table
    ->> for example int* ptr = &i;
    then in symbol table 
    ->>> i --> 710
    ->>> ptr --> 810 
    i variable 710 number location pe he aur i ka pointer 810 pe
