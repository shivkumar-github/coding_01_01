# Basic mistakes that can happen
## Read question properly otherwise you will find a solution for question not asked
### 1. Interchanging of "==" and "=".

### 2. Not returning any value or returning value of different type.

### 3. just go step by step calmly otherwise small mistakes will happen due to ignorance.

### 4. When we are using a pointer then check for cases when it is null and make sure that they are resolved else it will give segmentation fault

### n = head->next; and if head-> next is NULL 
### then when we do n = new node(10) then it does not get attached to head you should do head -> next = new node(10)

### 5. Always remember divide and rule it makes the problems lot easier
