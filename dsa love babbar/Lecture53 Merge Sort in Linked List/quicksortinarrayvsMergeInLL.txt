Why quick sort is prefered in arrays and merge sort in linked list?
Merge Sort for Linked Lists:

Efficient Splitting: Merge sort easily splits linked lists into two halves using the slow/fast pointer approach.
Memory Efficiency: Merge sort works well with linked lists as it doesn't require random access, making it memory efficient.
Quick Sort for Arrays:

Cache Efficiency: Quick sort benefits from cache locality in arrays, as it accesses contiguous memory locations.
In-place Sorting: Quick sort is in-place and doesn't require additional memory, making it suitable for arrays.
