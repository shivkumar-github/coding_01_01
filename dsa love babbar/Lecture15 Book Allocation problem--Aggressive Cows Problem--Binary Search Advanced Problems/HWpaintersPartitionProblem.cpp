Problem statement
Given an array/list of length ‘n’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘k’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards.
Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.

You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘n’ boards under a constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.

Example :
Input: arr = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3], k = 2

Output: 11
// question same  as that of book allocation problem
// all work will be done when all painers will finish their job => when the painter having maximum length to paint will complete his work
// maximum time(i.e. length of board) taken by a painter in the distibution should be minimum => which indicates the binary search can be applied
