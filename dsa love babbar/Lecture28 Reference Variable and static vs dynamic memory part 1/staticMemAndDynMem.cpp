/*
int n;
cin >> n;
int arr[n] -> array created using static memory allocation
according to C++ standards it is wrong to create an array like this only newer compilers support these type of VLA(variable length arrays) 
instead we create an array of greater size (as we did in matrix wale questions) for example arr[1000]

for more details about heap and stack memory you can refer to
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-vs-heap-memory-allocation/
which also conatins the main keypoints in a table at last which can be used to revise

->> In brief,
    when the program executes,the main memory divided into three parts.
    One part for code section, the second one is heap memory and another one is stack memory.
    Remember that the program can directly access only the stack memory,
    it canâ€™t directly access the heap memory so we need the help of pointer to access the heap memory.
->> But in short you can say that heap memory can be resised at runtime and stack is determined at compile time
and new keyword returns the address of the memory allocated in heap
->> we have to free up the heap memory  by ourselves
