in place ->>
         In place algorithm is an algorithm that uses only constant space O(1) 
         on internet it is inplace but won't it's space complexity will be O(log n) just like in case of merge sort it is storing a pivot which will be repeated log n times
 and 
stable  ->> (just a single equal to sign creates the difference)
        not stable as relative order of equal elements is not maintained 

code it and dry run karo->>
        khud code karke dry run karna hai -completed
