// C++ allows you to specify more than one definition for an operator in the same scope, which is called operator overloading.
// You can redefine or overload most of the built-in operators available in C++
// This can be only used on user defined data types only , behavior of operators can not be chaná¹‡ged for inbuilt data types 
// It is a type of polymorphism in which an operator is overloaded to give user defined meaning to it.
// Almost any operator can be overloaded in C++. However there are few operator which can not be overloaded. Operator that are not overloaded are follows-
// 1.scope resolution operator (::)
// 2.sizeof
// 3.member selector -(.)
// 4.member pointer selector - (*)
// 5.ternary operator (?:)
