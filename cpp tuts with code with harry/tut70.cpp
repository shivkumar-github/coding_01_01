/*
Containers in C++

there are three types of containers

1. Sequence Containers -> Linear fashion
    I. It has vectors
    => Random Access(RA) = fast compared to array
    => Middle Insertion/Delition = slow
    => Insertion at the end = fast

    II. It has lists
    => RA = slow 
    => M. Insertion = fast
    => Ins/Del at the end = end

2. Associative Containers -> Direct Access
    => All operations fast except RA 

3. Derived Containers -> Real world modeling
    stack -> last in first out -> lifo
    queue -> first in first out
    priority queue
    Depends (learn in Data structures)
