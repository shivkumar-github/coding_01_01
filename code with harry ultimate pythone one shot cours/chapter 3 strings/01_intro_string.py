# string can be made in three ways
name = "harry"
name1 = 'shivkumar'
name2 = '''string3''' #triple single quotes
print(name,name1,name2)
print(len(name))

# string in python can be sliced to get parts of the string
# string in python is immutable but we can completely assign new value to string
# In py in normal numbering  we start with 0 and in reverse (negative) numbering we starat with -1( in reverse y will have index -1 r -2 and so on)
