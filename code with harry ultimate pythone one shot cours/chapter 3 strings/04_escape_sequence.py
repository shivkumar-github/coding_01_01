# a = "this is a 
# string" ->. wrong
# a = '''this is a multiline  
# string''' ->> we can directly write multiline string in triple quote only

a = "this is a \n string"
print(a)

b = "his name is \"shivkumar\""
print(b)

# same for single quote and also we can use \t for tab

c = "he  is shivkumar \\"
print(c)
