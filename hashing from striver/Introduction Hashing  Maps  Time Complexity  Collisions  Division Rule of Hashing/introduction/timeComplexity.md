# Time Complextity -> map
where N is Number of elements in the map

### storing and fetching both take log N  in -> worst, best, average cases
        


#  Time Complextity ->unordered map
### storing and fetching takes O(1) in avg and best cases  but
### in worst case -> O(N) 
 worst cases happen very rarely(collisions) hence our first preference should be unordered map and only switch to ordered map when TLE happens by unordered
